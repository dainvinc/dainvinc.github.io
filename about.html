<h2>Hello Everyone!</h2> 
<img class="profile-picture" src="images/vishal.jpg" alt="Vishal's image">

<p>My name is <strong>Vishal</strong>. I'm the creator of this blog. <br/>
I'm a student at Marist College pursuing my Master's in Computer Science.
Ever since a kid I'm passionate about computers. It all started with a video
game named "Road Rash" which I'm pretty sure every kid in the early 2000s
must have heard of. Slowly, that interest in video games evolved and I
thought I had to create something, so 4 years ago I had created my first
website. And, this interest towards developing grew day by day and I also
started developing android applications. </p>
<p>I'm also very passionate about Cricket. It could be virtually or 
in reality but the game always drives me crazy. Well, that's one of my hobbies
(i.e., playing Cricket or watching Cricket), my other hobbies include reading
online articles(especially, topics related to IoT), and I even like to swim.</p>
