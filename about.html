        <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Vishal. I'm the creator of this blog. <br/>
    I'm a student at Marist College pursuing my Master's in Computer Science.
    Ever since a kid I'm passionate about computers. It all started with a video
    game named "Road Rash" which I'm pretty sure every kid in the Early 2000s
    must have heard of. Slowly, that interest in video games evolved and I
    thought I had to create something, so 4 years ago I had created my first
    website. And, this interest towards developing grew day by day and I also
    started developing android applications. <br />
    I'm also very passionate about the game Cricket. It could be a virtuality or
    reality but the game always drives me crazy. Well, that's one of my hobbies(
    i.e., playing Cricket or watching Cricket), my other hobbies include reading
    online articles(especially, topics related to IoT), and I even like to swim.
